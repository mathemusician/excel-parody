# excel-parody

*excel parody written in streamlit*

This is to help a friend. Hopefully this lets you
understand what the potential roadblocks would be
if you want to make something like excel in python

# How to run

```bash
# install a python version near 3.9.0
pip3 install streamlit pyparsing
streamlit run main_page.py
```

# Specs

1) 4 x 4 calculator/excel parody
2) ability to reference cells
3) two functions, min and avg
4) error handling: please fix cell reference, {}
5) ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
6) no floats, just positive integers


# Libraries

streamlit
pyparsing
pandas


# Outside of Scope
floats
parentheses
changing formula rerenders page
proper error handling (like divide by zero)
colons (A1:A4)
